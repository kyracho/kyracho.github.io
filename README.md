# My Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome! This repository contains the source files for my personal website.

It consists of:
1. Cover Page with an animated background
3. About Me
4. Customized Virtual Interview Chatbot. Hosted by myself on AWS using the MERN stack. I built the frontend of the chatbot to work seamlessly, similarly to the iMessage app. 
6. Projects, I wrote javascript to dynamically organize and resize the masonry style tiles depending on the device and the current window size. The tiles link to my recent projects.
7. Dynamic buttons that will link to my future miscellaneous projects.
8. My Location

Here is the current snapshot of my website:
